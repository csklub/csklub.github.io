**CSKlub** is a community of people who are passionate about
computer science and technology. We are a group of students who
are eager to learn and share our knowledge with others. Our goal
is to create a space where people can come together to discuss
ideas, collaborate on projects, and explore new technologies.
Whether you are a beginner or an expert, we welcome you to join
us and be a part of our community.

This is an initiative by [blackbored.](https://bored.black/) that
aims to bring together like-minded individuals who are interested
in taking the craft a notch higher.

We are community of _life-long learners_.
